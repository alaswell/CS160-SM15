CS160: Foundations in Programming

The purpose of this lab is to write Java code over the following topics:

    Take today's quiz over the material in the last recitation
    To understand how to use conditionals
    To continue to use Java data input using a Java Scanner
    To continue to format output with printf
    Interpret simple Java programs 

Today's quiz
You should create a new Java Project called Q4 and make a class named Q4.

Please see the screen for today's quiz over the material presented and worked on in the last presentation.
Java Programming
Create a new Java Project named R4 and make a class named R4.
If Statements

    Instantiate a scanner.
    Prompt the user with "Enter an integer: ", using System.out.print().
    Use the scanner to read an integer from the user (the console) and store it into a variable.
    Write an if statement with a condition that is true when the number is negative, and false otherwise.
    When the number is negative, print a line with "Negative number: " and the number, and assign the negative of the number back to itself.
    When the number is Positive, print a line with "Positive number: " and the number.
    After the conditional, print a line with "Absolute value: " and the number. 

If, Else-If Block Statements

    Prompt the user with "Enter a double: ", using System.out.print().
    Have your scanner take in a double and store it into a variable named salary.
    Create a new double named taxes. Leave it uninitialized
    Write an if/else block that satisfies the following tax brackets
        when 0 ≤ salary < $1,000 then:
        you pay no taxes.
        when $1,000 ≤ salary < $10,000 then:
        you pay 15% of your salary in taxes.
        when $10,000 ≤ salary < $50,000 then:
        you pay 23% of your salary in taxes.
        when $50,000 ≤ salary < $100,000 then:
        you pay 28% of your salary in taxes.
        otherwise if your salary is ≥ $100,000 then:
        you pay a flat $200,000 tax. 
    Print "Taxes: $" + taxes to the console.
    Modify the printing of the taxes variable to use the printf.
    Verify you see exactly two digits after the decimal point.
    Is it possible that taxes will not have a value by the time it gets printed?
    Write a comment explaining why, or why not. 

Interpret Java
You will be given a sheet of paper with Java code on it and asked to interpret what that code does. Answer the questions, log into RamCT, and take the Interpretation exercise for R3.
