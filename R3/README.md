CS160: Foundations in Programming

The purpose of this lab is to write Java code over the following topics:

    Take today's quiz over the material in the last recitation
    To continue to use Java String methods
    Understand Java data input using a Java Scanner
    Practice using the printf method in Java
    Interpret simple Java programs 

Today's quiz
You should create a new Java Project called Q3 and make a class named Q3.

Please see the screen for today's quiz over the material presented and worked on in the last presentation.
Java Programming
Create a new Java Project named R3 and make a class named R3.
Scanner
Your TA will help you add to R3.java to do the following:

    Declare the variables needed below with meaningful names.
    Prompt the user for their first and last name (entered on a single line). Leave the cursor at the end of the question.
    Use a Scanner object to read the name as a string.
    Prompt the user for each of the following as needed. For each prompt leave the cursor at the end of the question.
    Read the month you were born as a string.
    Read the day of the month you were born as an integer.
    Read the year you were born as an integer.
    Print the following: 

Russ Wakefield was born on September 13, 1955.
Russ's first name has 4 characters in it.
Russ's last name has 9 characters in it.
His initials are RW.


You should verify that your code works correctly at this point.
System.out.printf & String manipulation
Add to R3.java to do the following:

    Prompt the user for each of the following as needed. For each prompt leave the cursor at the end of the question.
    Print a blank line.
    Read in the users bank balance (pretend you have more than $1000 in the bank).
    Read today's date as a string in the form mm/dd/yyyy (in exactly that form).
    Create a string with the day of the month in it.
    Using printf, print the following (fill in the values read and computed).

    The bank balance for Russ Wakefield on 24th of this month is $1,325.45.

Interpret Java
You will be given a sheet of paper with Java code on it and asked to interpret what that code does. Answer the questions, log into RamCT, and take the Interpretation exercise for R3.
