CS160: Foundations in Programming

Java Programming

    Create a new Java Project named R13
    Copy R13Interface.java into the project.
    Create a class called R13 and have it implement R13Interface.
    Write the methods in the interface according to the pre and post conditions in the interface.
    Create a set of test cases in the main method that test your methods.
    Once your code passes your test cases, check in just the file R13.java using the website checkin page
    The comprehensive testing will check your code in the final grade.
    You will receive a grade for this work based on how well your code works.
