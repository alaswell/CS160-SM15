CS160: Foundations in Programming

The purpose of this lab is to write Java code over the following topics:

    Take today's quiz over the material in the last recitation
    To implement a seperate class according to specifications
    To implement a class using an interface.
    To understand iterative development. 

Today's quiz
You should create a new Java Project called Q10 and make a class named Q10.

Please go to the location identified by the TA for today's quiz.

Java Programming

    Create a new Java Project named R10
    Copy R10Admit.java into the project.
    Copy R10Interface.java into the project.
    Create a class called R10Room and have it implement R10Interface.
        The TA will help you do this. 
    Write the methods in the interface according to the pre and post conditions in the interface.
    Create a set of test cases in the main method that test your methods.
    Once your code passes your test cases, run your code using R10Admit.
    Check in just the file R10Room.java using the website checkin page
    Verify your results with the test server.
