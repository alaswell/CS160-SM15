CS160: Foundations in Programming

The purpose of this lab is to write Java code over the following topics:

    Take today's quiz over the material in the last recitation
    To implement a seperate class according to specifications
    To implement a class using an interface.
    To build methods that use arrays
    To understand iterative development. 

Today's quiz
You should create a new Java Project called Q12 and make a class named Q12.

Please go to the location identified by the TA for today's quiz.

Java Programming

    Create a new Java Project named R12
    Copy R12Interface.java into the project.
    Create a class called R12 and have it implement R12Interface.
        The TA will help you do this. 
    Write the methods in the interface according to the pre and post conditions in the interface.
    Create a set of test cases in the main method that test your methods.
    Once your code passes your test cases, run your code.
    Check in just the file R12.java using the website checkin page
    Verify your results with the test server.
    You will receive 2 grades for today's recitation, the first is for your quiz grade, your second is for your recitation code.
