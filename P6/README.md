CS160: Foundations in Programming

The purpose of this lab is to write Java code over the following topics:

    To implement a seperate class according to specifications
    To implement a class using an interface.
    To build methods that build, use, and return arrays
    To understand iterative development. 

Java Programming

    Create a new Java Project named P6
    Copy P6Interface.java into the project.
    Create a class called P6 and have it implement P6Interface.
    Write the methods in the interface according to the pre and post conditions in the interface.
    Create a set of test cases in the main method that test your methods.
    Once your code passes your test cases, run your code.
    Check in just the file P6.java using the website checkin page
    Verify your results with the test server.
